## Ballz Game

I coded an interactive graphics game using C and GFX where the user aim and shoot the balls at the squares.

You earn points by making each square disappear.

As you earn more points, you also earn more balls to shoot.

Don't let any of the balls hit the bottom or else you lose the game!
